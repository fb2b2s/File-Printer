# Steps to use

1) Run the java program by providing a filepath, columns count (number of columns present in the file), the limit of characters per line and the quantifier for spacing between columns (1,2,..) (file should be a text document in tabular format with each column separated by a "tab" space) as one and only argument
2) The output of the program will be a well indented table like view with each column starting from the same alignment
